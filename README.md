the zip file is the same as the two files I left them open that way you can see what they are. 
TO TEST IT if you dont know how a start .bat works and dont want to download the the .zip put the two the two files in folder and name it thisfile 
put folder in c and the start bat will open a program called shotcut "very nice free program by the way for video editing" and full screen it using Fll. 
shotcut is free openware if you want to download to test
